###What is Quantum computing?
It is the harnessing of quantum physics for the use in computing applications.

###Why is it useful
In binary programing applications logic is build upon bits with 2 degrees of freedom where as in quantum computing the degrees
of freedom grow exponentially with each added quantum bit.

###What kind of code can we write?
If we have access to a Quantum Computer (QC) we can code logic to take advantage of the superposition of states in the
quantum world. We can design algorithms that would not be possible to run in the normal 2 bit world.
